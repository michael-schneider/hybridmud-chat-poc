i18n is prepared but does not run: You cannot switch languages in both, JIT and AOT reliably. To be honest, I wan't able to figure it out for Jit.

Second Problem: How to do routing in both, JJIT and AOT

AOT is its whole project

SystemJS vs Webpack

Problem: How to give language to server: Protocol or resource descriptor.

I decided, to wait for further developments in i18n in angular.

To bu√Æld AOT:

  npm run build-i18n

To test locally:
  npm install -g http-server
  cd dist
  http-server

  Open Browser: 127.0.0.1:8080



   ng serve --aot --i18nFile=src/locale/messages.de.xlf --i18nFormat=xlf --locale=de ng serve --aot --i18nFile=src/locale/messages.de.xlf --i18nFormat=xlf --locale=de
